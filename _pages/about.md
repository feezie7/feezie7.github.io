I am a prospective PhD Student in Computer Science with interests centered around  Natural Language Processing for low resource languages, Machine Learning systems as well as the application of AI to the security of Information systems. I have experience with Programming in Java and Python. These experiences were accrued from both my Position as a Faculty and Systems Analyst at [Summit University, Offa, Nigeria](https://www.summituniversity.edu.ng) and my undergraduate and MSc. research work at [Kwara State University, Malete, Nigeria](https://web.kwasu.edu.ng).
