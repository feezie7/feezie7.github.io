I obtained my BSc in Computer Science from [Bayero University Kano](https://buk.edu.ng) in Nigeria, where I also developed a strong foundation in the basic ideas of programming and computing. Using this information as a foundation, I continued my education and earned a MSc degree from [Kwara State University](https://web.kwasu.edu.ng) in Malete, Nigeria, where I was able to deepen my knowledge and comprehension of the domain.

I am currently a doctoral degree researcher at the [University of Ilorin](https://unilorin.edu.ng) in Nigeria. Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and human-robot interaction are the main areas of my research. This topic of study reflects my significant interest in the fundamental field of artificial intelligence, where I aim to address the difficulties in creating models for human-robot interaction and how to use them in real-time.

My study focuses on using self-supervised learning to create generic language models for human-robot interaction and investigating how these models might be utilized in real time to predict and anticipate human behaviour and therefore enhance the interaction.
I demonstrate my dedication to academic achievement and a profound desire for furthering the field of artificial intelligence with my extensive educational background and pursuit of a PhD. My study demonstrates my commitment to identifying practical answers that might enhance human-robot interaction.
